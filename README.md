# Hidden Inventory

Hidden Inventory is a [Cubari](https://cubari.moe) repository for *Jujutsu Kaisen* releases by  [TCB Scans](https://tcbscans.com). Read them [here](https://cubari.moe/read/gist/cmF3L21jcmFkY2xpZmZlMjQ5MC9oaWRkZW4taW52ZW50b3J5L21haW4vY3ViYXJpLmpzb24/). This is a fork of the repository Punk Records by celsiusnarhwal. All credit goes to them for the logic that makes this repository work. I've left their credit in the cubari page for this reason.

Hidden Inventory is maintained automatically by [Tengen](/tengen) and updated daily around 10:00 UTC and 22:00 UTC.
